# Detecting_Shill_Bidders_with_Statistics
Whoever is familiar with the context of online auctions might have witnessed, sometimes in his life, the uncomfortable experience of shill bidding. With the term shill bidding we refer to: <br>
*"the illegal practice of sellers who, during the auctions of their own products, place bids on their goods in
order to drive up the price.‚Äù* <br>
In this project, we will take a closer look to the practice of shill bidding in a statistical framework. We will consider a list of records about auctions that took place in one of the biggest e-commerce company
worldwide and we will carry out a complete statistical analysis on this data set. <br>
The project is divided in the following parts:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Regression methods
4. Classification task
5. Conclusions
